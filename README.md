# Decision Tree Implementation for Mushroom Classification

## Overview
This project implements a custom decision tree classifier from scratch to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on their physical attributes. The decision tree algorithm is built step-by-step, including feature selection, entropy calculation, and information gain computation. 

## Features
- Implements a decision tree classifier from scratch
- Uses entropy and information gain for feature selection
- Classifies mushrooms as edible or poisonous

## Dataset
The dataset contains 10 examples of mushrooms, each described by three features: cap color, stalk shape, and solitariness. Each mushroom is labeled as either edible (1) or poisonous (0).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aanchalparegi/Decision-Tree-Implementation.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Decision-Tree-Implementation`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook C2_W4_Decision_Tree_with_Markdown.ipynb`

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Credits
This project was developed by Aanchal Paregi. It was completed as part of Machine learning assignment at Laurentian University, with guidance from proffesor Farhad Abbasi Amiri.
